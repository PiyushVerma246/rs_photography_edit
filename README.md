🚀 About the Project

RS Photography Edit is my first-ever hard-coded web development project, built in 2023 when I had just started learning web development.

This project was created from scratch, with every line of code handwritten, and without using any AI tools, generators, or frameworks.
It represents my foundational learning phase and marks the beginning of my journey into frontend development.

The website is designed as a creative resource platform for photographers, designers, editors, and content creators.


🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of RS Photography Edit was to:

Practice real-world HTML & CSS structuring

Understand layout design and UI flow

Improve styling, responsiveness, and consistency

This project focuses more on learning and fundamentals rather than perfection.
