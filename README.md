## 🚀 About the Project

**RS Photography Edit** is my **first-ever hard-coded web development project**, built in **2023** when I had just started learning web development.

This project was created **from scratch**, with every line of code **handwritten**, and **without using any AI tools, frameworks, or libraries**.

It marks the beginning of my frontend development journey and represents my learning phase, experimentation, and growth.
